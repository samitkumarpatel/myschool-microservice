### myschool-ui

To start this application:

- Install vue CLI
- `npm install`
- `vue serve App.vue`

## why index.html and index.js is needed?
- To assign some pre defined css framework like bootstrap and little bit more user friendly layout. If this file are in place, Vue will not generate on his own.. It will try to reuse.
